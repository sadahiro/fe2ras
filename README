fe2ras is a rasterizer that takes one tecplot file with finite
element list(your file).  This will create *.drb files as an output,
which is rasterized binary file of the source file.  There are some
assumptions sine supporting tecplot file is difficult as it is very
extensive file format.  It assumes first three vars are x, y, and z.
It should parse how many ever variables you have.  Usage is "fe2ras
inputFile resX resY resZ"  I normally use 128 for resX, Y, and Z to
tell te2ras to rasterize 1 pixel for 128 floating point unit.  This
command line is if you run fe2ras on one input file.  I used
"launcher" script to launch multiple jobs over 4 nodes (48 cores).
For the size of Seamount192, you need about 10 min to finish the job
which is already specified on the sge script in the dir.  As you can
see I put each tec file in a dir so I can get "ls" back more easily
(and distribute over diff disks).  You can run this on flat file
system, but not recommended.  Someone from TACC may email you a
nastigram eventually.  If you look into Seamout dir there, you will
see submission script and paramlist file along your seamount data.  I
use "launcher" script that is built into tacc systems.  If you just
copy entire seamount dir to your dir, and submit the job from the dir
where .sge file is, it should just work.
