fe2ras is a rasterizer that takes one tecplot file with a finite element list(your file).  One large difference from regular rasterizer is that fe2ras uses Barycentric coordinate system since standard rasterization method can not represent distance/weight from arbitrary coordinate to the vertices of triangle tiles.  This will create *.drb files as an output, which is a rasterized binary file of the source file.  There are some assumptions since supporting the tecplot file is difficult as it is a very extensive file format.  It assumes the first three vars are x, y, and z.  It should parse how many ever variables you have.  Usage is "fe2ras inputFile resX resY resZ"  I normally use 128 for resX, Y, and Z to tell te2ras to rasterize 1 pixel for 128 floating point units.  This command line is if you run fe2ras on one input file.  I used the "launcher" script to launch multiple jobs over 4 nodes (48 cores).  For the size of Seamount192, you need about 10 min to finish the job which is already specified on the sge script in the dir.  As you can see I put each tec file in a dir so I can get "ls" back more easily (and distributed over diff disks).  You can run this on a flat file system, but it is not recommended.  Someone from TACC may email you a nastigram eventually.  If you look into Seamount dir there, you will see submission script and paramlist file along your seamount data.  I use a "launcher" script that is built into tacc systems.  If you just copy the entire seamount dir to your dir, and submit the job from the dir where the .sge file is, it should just work.
